# Northern-3D-Scanner
The Northern 3D Scanner compromises of three links. The first link connected to the base, the second link connected to the first link, and a third link connected to the camera. The three links are controlled by three motors with the ability to change the position of the camera that is in connection with the third link. To allow the camera to view the back side of the object being scanned, a forth moter is used to rotate said object. The fourth motor is connected to a rotatable plate which allows the object to be placed apon. The Northern 3D Scanner currently uses laser triangulation to preform scans allowing the ability to switch between any opensource software such as makerscanner or possibly horus.
